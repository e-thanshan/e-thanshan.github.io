                    <p>This was a major semi-solo project that I worked on during my internship over the summer at BCTC. My job was to work with a UX/UI designer to remake the homepage of a coding school managed by BCTC. 
                        This website was built on a React + Typescript + Vite + TailwindCSS stack that called to a backend built with Nodejs and Express, and handled Prisma calls to a PostgreSQL database. 
                        Much of the work on this site was on the frontend, ensuring that the website was easy to use across all devices.
                         A big challenge on this site was a course browser component that allowed users to look and sort through featured courses. Writing code to efficiently sort courses by age group, difficulty, start date, and topic proved to be a challenging but highly rewarding experience.</p>

                    <p>This was another project that I worked on during my internship that teaches students how to code, in a similar fashion to how Codecademy does it, but we utilize OpenAI's API services to provide personalized help, regardless of where a student may have trouble on.
                        This was built on a React + Typescript + Vite + TailwindCSS stack that called to a backend built with Nodejs and Express, and handled Prisma calls to a PostgreSQL database.
                        I mostly worked on the page as shown on the image, which was the page that students would see when they were working through a lesson. It contains 4 resizable sections; A problem description, a code editor (monaco), a code output, and a help section powered by AI.
                        Making sure all sections worked fine while being resizable was a challenge, but I learned a lot about how to use CSS to make sure that all sections were responsive and worked well on all devices.
